# Bootstrap Theme Kit: Styling/govgr-bootstrap-theme

A project to help you get started quickly when developing a website for GOV.GR using Bootstrap.
It includes a project structure with a gulp script that builds a custom CSS version of Bootstrap 4, according to the styling guidelines of GOV.GR
This allows to customize the default GOV.GR bootstrap theme easily, using Sass variables. The result will be a theme that you can apply to new and existing sites based on  Bootstrap 4 projects to give them the new GOV.GR look. 

## Getting started

All the neccessary files reside inside the `Styling/govgr-bootstrap-theme-kit` folder.

### Default theme customization ###
If you want to build your own customized version of the GOV.GR bootstrap theme:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `gulp watch`
4. Open `templates/index.html` in a browser to check the default styling.
4. Add any custom Bootstrap Sass variables into `scss/_custom-variables.scss`
5. Add any custom styles into `scss/_custom-styles.scss`. You can use Bootstrap's mixins here.
6. Repeat steps 4 to 6 until you like what you see :-)



### Default theme customization ###
If you simply want to apply the GOV.GR style to your existing or new websites,  you can grab the compiled css file `css/govgr_bootstrap.css` and include it in your site.
