# Bootstrap Theme Kit: Styling/govgr-bootstrap-theme

This is simple starter project to help you get started quickly when developing a website using Bootstrap.
It includes a project structure with a build script that builds a custom CSS version of Bootstrap 4, according to the main styling guidelines of gov.gr.


## Getting started

If you want to build your own customized version of the gov.gr bootstrap theme:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `gulp watch`
4. Add any custom Bootstrap Sass variables into `scss/_custom-variables.scss`
5. Add any custom styles into `scss/_custom-styles.scss`. You can use Bootstrap's mixins here.
6. Repeat steps 4 to 6 until you like what you see :-)

or you can simply grab the compiled css files `css/govgr_bootstrap.css` and include it in your site.
