# Bootstrap Theme Kit: Styling/govgr-bootstrap-theme

![](./Styling/govgr-bootstrap-theme-kit/examples/images/logo_govgr_pos.png)

A project to help you get started quickly when developing a website for [gov.gr](https://www.gov.gr "Βρείτε τη δημόσια υπηρεσία που θέλετε - gov.gr") using Bootstrap.
It includes a project structure with a gulp script that builds a custom CSS version of Bootstrap 4, according to the styling guidelines of gov.gr.
This allows to customize the default gov.gr bootstrap theme easily, using Sass variables. The result will be a theme that you can apply to new and existing sites based on  Bootstrap 4 projects to give them the new gov.gr look. 

## Getting started

All the neccessary files reside inside the `Styling/govgr-bootstrap-theme-kit` folder.

Example pages and components created using the theme can be found [here](https://govgr.github.io/govgr-bootstrap-theme-kit/Styling/govgr-bootstrap-theme-kit/examples/ "examples").

### Default theme customization ###
If you want to build your own customized version of the GOV.GR bootstrap theme:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `gulp watch`
4. Open `templates/index.html` in a browser to check the default styling.
4. Add any custom Bootstrap Sass variables into `scss/_custom-variables.scss`
5. Add any custom styles into `scss/_custom-styles.scss`. You can use Bootstrap's mixins here.
6. Repeat steps 4 to 6 until you like what you see :-)


### Default theme customization ###
If you simply want to apply the gov.gr style to your existing or new websites,  you can grab the compiled css file `css/govgr_bootstrap.css` and include it in your site.
